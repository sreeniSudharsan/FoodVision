# FoodVision

This is a food recognition model trained on the EfficientNet architecture using the Food101 dataset taken from the paper 
"Food-101-Mining Discriminative Components with Random Forests". The dataset contains 101 food categories with 
101,000 images and all images were rescaled to have a maximum side length of 512 pixels.

With this model, 

  - One can predict the type of dish their image is or the dish that looks closest to it from the 101 food
    categories.
